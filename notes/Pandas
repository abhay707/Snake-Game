-> We can manipulate the data of spreadsheet(tabular data) just like files
-> The post which is used in it is .csv
-> We can apply python to extract the data from a table

                                            Import csv

It is an python library with is used to manipulate the data of the spreadsheet

-> First you have to open the file then we can use csv.reader

* csv.reader = It is used to read the csv type file data
    Syntax:
    data = csv.reader("File name")
    print(data)

-> Now we can apply any command to that data like loop or conditions to go through the data
-> We get the data in a particular string formatting by csv.reader

                                            Import Pandas

-> csv cannot be used for big projects or large about of data so here comes another library know as panda
-> Panda has many functionality that helps us to manipulate the data and complete task easily
-> We do not have to open the file to use the pandas

* pandas.read_csv = it is used to read the csv file
    syntax:
        data = pandas.read_csv("file name")

* data.to_dict = convert our data to dictionary (to_html, to_exel, to_sql)
* data.to_csv = convert any data to csv file
* pandas.DataFrame = To read the data

-> Pandas return two types of data dataframe and series
    -> Whole table in the spreadsheet refers to dataframe
    -> Each single column in that series
