                                                    Why Error Handling

-> We stumble through an error between the codes our project after that error will not work
-> In that case error handling is used to accept that error and our remaining program will work without any issue
-> We can catch and except the error

* "try" = Something that might cause an exception
* "Except" = Do this if there was an exception
* "else" = Do this if there were no exceptions
* "finally" = Do this no matter what happen
* "raise" = Used to raise an error intentionally
